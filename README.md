## What Makes This Class Unique?
This plugin demonstrates a simple way to implement delayed and dismissible admin notices in WordPress. This implementation of notices is most notably unique in that itâ€¦
1. allows any number of unique notices to be added to a plugin.
1. allows dismissal forever or allows for a user to request a reminder in one week or one month.
1. allows the notice to display on any number of admin pages (including those added by other plugins having only a `?page=` parameter in the URL).
1. allows defining a capability per notice which controls the users to whom a notice is shown.
1. implements dismissals on a per user basis.
1. allows full styling of the notice.
1. allows for both a plugin activation notice and delayed notices.

## How to Use it
1. Add the `typewheel-notice/` folder to your root directory.
1. Include the code from `plugin.php` in your root file.
1. Search & replace all instances of `your_prefix_` in the root file. *(prefix should be unique to project)*
1. In the `register_deactivation_hook`, replace `typewheel-notice.php` with the name of your root file.
1. Customize your notices.

## How to Customize a Notice
All of the following arguments can be customized in each notice array

`$prefix . '-unique-notice-id' => array()` *(This array id will be used to track dismissals and must be unique for each notice. Do not modify the $prefix)*

`'trigger' => {true|false}` *(This flags whether or not the notice should be shown)*

`'time' => time() +/- {int}` *(when should the notice be made active? replace {int} with number of seconds before/after activation)*

`'dismiss' => array({week,month})` *(whether to include an option to dismiss for one week or one month)*

`'type' => {success|error|warning|info}` *(optional) (whether to include WP notice styling)*

`'icon' => {dashicon-slug}` *(optional) (prepends a dashicon to the notice)*

`'content' => ''` *(required) (string with content of notice)*

`'style' => array() or ''` *(optional) (array of CSS parameters/values)*

`'location' => array()` *(required) (array of pages on which to show the notice)*

`'capability' => ''` *(optional) (to whom should the notice be shown? defaults to `read`.)*
